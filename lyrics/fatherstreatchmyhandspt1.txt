If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
If I ever instigated, I'm sorry
Tell me, who in here can relate? I, I, I
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some'
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
If I ever instigated, I'm sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
